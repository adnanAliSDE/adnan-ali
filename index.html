      <h1>Hi! I am Adnan Ali <br />A Web Developer</h1>
      <p>
        Welcome to my portfolio website! I am a skilled web developer with a
        specialization in frontend web development using technologies like HTML,
        CSS, and JavaScript. I have successfully created several projects that
        highlight my expertise in these technologies. My last project was a blog
        website that I designed and developed myself using Python and Django in
        the backend. This project allowed me to showcase my skills in building
        dynamic web applications. I also possess extensive experience in Python
        and Django, as well as working knowledge in UI/UX design. Thank you for
        visiting my portfolio, and I look forward to discussing potential
        projects with you
